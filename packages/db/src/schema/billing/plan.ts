/**
 * Plan limits are DATA, not constants. Nothing in apps/server may hardcode any

 *
 * **The values live in `packages/db/src/seed.ts`** -- that file is the source of
 * truth, and `just db-seed` applies it. Changing the Pro credit count is an edit
 * there plus a commit, so it is reviewed and has a git blame, and applying it is
 * a database write rather than a server release.
 *
 * Invariant when changing monthlyCredits: costCeilingCents >= monthlyCredits x
 * p95 cost per diagram. Otherwise the ceiling binds before the advertised
 * credit limit and a paying user is cut off below what the UI promised.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: the Dodo product id. It is per-mode (test and live
 * products are different objects) and lives in DODO_PRO_PRODUCT_ID so that
 * going live is an env swap with no code or data change. Mirroring it here
 * would make the mode switch a two-place edit that silently half-applies.
