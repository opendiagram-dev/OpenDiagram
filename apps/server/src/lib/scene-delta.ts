/**
 * Merging canvas scene deltas.
 *
 * The canvas used to PATCH its whole scene on every save (70 kB avg, 248 kB max,
 * several times a minute). A delta carries only the elements whose Excalidraw
 * version moved since the client's last acknowledged revision, a couple kB in
 * the common case.
 *
 * Buys wire bytes, not database time. Postgres rewrites the whole TOASTed jsonb
 * value either way, so write cost is unchanged until the scene moves out of the
 * row entirely.
 *
 * TODO: move scene to R2 and keep only a key + revision on the row. That removes
 * the TOAST rewrite, the WAL churn, and the 16x bloat on project_file_content.
 * Both Excalidraw and tldraw hold blobs in object storage keyed by their own id.
 * This module is the seam: mergeSceneDelta already produces the whole next scene,
 * so the writer behind it can become a PUT without the wire format changing.
 */

/**
 * A delta is told from a full scene by these two fields, so both are required.
 *
 * A null base means "merge onto whatever revision the row holds now". Only the
 * unload beacon sends that: it is the one write with nothing alive to read a 409
 * or retry it, and a keepalive body cannot carry a whole scene instead (64 KiB
 * quota, our scenes average 70). It waives the client's revision check, not the
 * write's own guard, so a save landing between the merge and the write is still
 * rejected rather than silently overwritten.
