 * create paths know the row is new, the generation and PATCH paths know it
 * should exist, and none of them benefits from finding out. It also means a file
 * whose content row went missing repairs itself on the next write instead of
 * failing forever.
 *
 * Only the columns whose value is not `undefined` are written. That matters for
 * PATCH, where the client sends `scene` alone and must not blank `history` and
 * `spec` as a side effect. The test is on the value rather than key presence
 * (`"scene" in patch`) because an optional Zod field can land in the parsed
 * object as an explicit `undefined`, which key presence would treat as a write.
 * An explicit `null` still clears the column, which is the intended way to do it.
