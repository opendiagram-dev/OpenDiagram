 * API shape change touches this file, a Standard Webhooks change touches that one.
 *
 * Two callers only: the webhook handler, and `POST /api/billing/reconcile` (the
 * post-checkout confirmation, which verifies ownership against Dodo's copy before
 * calling in). Entitlement follows what Dodo says happened, never what a client
 * claims -- which is why neither caller passes anything a browser supplied.
