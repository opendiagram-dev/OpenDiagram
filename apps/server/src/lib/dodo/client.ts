/**
 * The Dodo Payments client, or null when billing isn't configured.
 *
 * Null is a supported state, not a failure: a self-hosted OpenDiagram has no
 * reason to set up a payment processor, so the billing routes 404 and everyone
 * resolves to the Free plan. That's why every DODO_* var is optional in
 * packages/env -- the app must still build and boot without them.
 *
 * `DODO_ENVIRONMENT` is passed straight through because the env enum uses the
 * SDK's own `'test_mode' | 'live_mode'` values; there is deliberately no mapping
 * layer to drift out of sync.
