/**
 * Composes the three things every non-streaming AI route needs into one call:
 * which model to run on, permission to run at all, and somewhere to report what
 * it cost.
 *
 * This sits above both `lib/quota` and `lib/repo-ai` rather than inside either,
 * because it is the seam between them. `lib/quota` deliberately knows nothing
 * about how models are invoked, and `lib/repo-ai` knows nothing about billing;
 * putting the glue in a route instead is what let project chat charge BYOK users
 * for inference we never paid for.
 *
 * Streaming routes (`routes/diagram.ts`) call `enforceAiQuota` directly, because
 * they settle from `onFinish`/`onError` callbacks rather than around an await.
